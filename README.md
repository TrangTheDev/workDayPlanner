# workDayPlanner

For this assignment we were asked to construct a day planner which will allow the user to save their task into the hourly blocks provided.
The details is saved on their local storage and then when the page is revisited the input is retrived from the local storage and displayed on the browser.

I was able to create my rows, time-blocks and save buttom in the javascript by inserting the element into the DOM.

The hours presented are colour coded to indicate the past, present and future hours and i have included a ticking clock to indicate the date and time on the browser.
